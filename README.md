Deployed Jokes API on heroku: https://fathomless-castle-77616.herokuapp.com

The goal was to create an api for an app that stores jokes. The user needed to be authenticated on sign-up/in and the user's authenticated actions must include the ability to create, show-all, edit and delete a resource.

The project was started by making sure the user and user routes were set up properly for the incoming requests. Then it was on to making a model for the joke, and creating the joke routes.

Some goals for future versions include:
- giving the user the ability to leave comments on jokes.
- adding a type to all jokes


User stories:

user should be able to sign up!
user should then be able to sign in!
user should then be able to change password
user should then be able to index all jokes
user should be able to create a joke
user should be able to edit their own joke
user should be able to delete their own joke
